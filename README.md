# RedFramework - Simple Template

## Description
This template will help you to gain some time to organize the structure of your missions. I recommend this structure to the newcomer.

## Getting started
 - Download template from github (clone or direct download)
 - Create your mission with 3den editor
 - Copy paste the contents into the mission folder
 - Remove .gitattributes

## Skeleton
    \function (Place your custom functions here)
    \lib (Place external libraries here)
    \media (Place your multimedia content here)
    \script (Place your custom scripts here)
    config.cpp (Allows you to declare your custom functions)
    init.sqf (This code is executed on the client and the server.)
    initServer.sqf (This code is executed from the server only.)
    description.ext (used to set the overall mission attributes or to define global entites.)
